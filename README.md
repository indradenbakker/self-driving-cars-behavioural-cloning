#**Use Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behavior**

When humans learn to drive, we use our experience to drive the same route with new circumstances and also to drive new routes. In this project we use a simulator to "show" a model how we would drive around a track. Afterwards, the model should mimic the human driving behaviour (behavioural cloning) and drive around the same track and a new track - which was not used for training.
